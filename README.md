# python-video-game

A video game I made in Python using the Pygame package.

I used this project as a way to learn Python and become familiar with programming in general. It is not representative of my current coding abilities. 

To run it, you will need all of the above files (except setup.py, which is used to turn game into executable). 

You will also require a Python 3 interpreter as well as all the packages that I have used (these are imported at the top of each .py file).
